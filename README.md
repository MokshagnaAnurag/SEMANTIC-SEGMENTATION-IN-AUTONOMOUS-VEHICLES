# SEMANTIC-SEGMENTATION-IN-AUTONOMOUS-VEHICLES
This project implements real-time semantic segmentation for autonomous driving using deep learning. It leverages datasets like CamVid, A2D2, Apollo, SYNTHIA, and IDD to train a segmentation model that classifies each pixel in an image into meaningful categories (e.g., roads, vehicles, pedestrians).
